# Machine Learning Library
A library of machine learning algorithms and techniques built from the ground up, using Numpy, Pandas, and PyPlot. This project will be similar to my [Linear Algebra library](https://github.com/EdwardSeley/LinearAlgebra) in that it will be independent of libraries like it (not relying on importing libraries such as sklearn for instance). 

## Example: Batch Gradient Descent
